      <h3>Our Vision</h3>
      <p>
        As frequent shoppers, we know how frustrating it can be to navigate large shopping centers. Many people struggle to find stores because of the limited number of navigation boards across the mall and usually take time to locate one if new to the mall. The Navigation Watch project aims to solve this problem by creating an easy-to-use, wearable device that helps shoppers find their way through malls with real-time, simple directions. Our vision for the future is to improve indoor navigation by connecting the watch to maps, offering personalized shopping suggestions, and adding features that make it more accessible to everyone. Our goal is to change how people experience shopping, making it easier and more enjoyable for everyone.

      <h3>Research</h3>
      <h2>Problem Discovery</h2>
      <hr class="section-divider">

      <p>
        Through the data collected from the searches, our statistics find that the pain points of current navigation boards mainly lie in three aspects. The first is the low level of <span class="highlight">user-friendliness</span>. Most users being observed either find it difficult to read the map on the board or find it hard to memorize, which leads to the second issue of unnecessary <span class="highlight">time consumption</span> and lining up during peak hours. The last problem is users’ low-level acceptance of <span class="highlight">mobile navigation apps</span>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Observation methods:</strong> We adopted the <span class="highlight">ethnographic study</span> method. We conducted our observation by observing how customers <span class="highlight">interact with navigation boards</span> in different shopping centers in Toronto. We also followed some of the customers to find out what problems they would encounter on their way to the destination. During this process, we took notes of their <span class="highlight">conversations, body language,</span> and <span class="highlight">facial expressions</span>. We also used a camera to record users' interactions with the navigation board when it was necessary.
      </p>

      <div class="image-watch-row">
        <img src="Watch Affinity.png" alt="Affinity Diagram">
      </div>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Our observation took place in five different shopping centers, including Square One, Scarborough Town Centre, Bramalea City Centre, Erin Mills Town Centre, and Yorkdale. Based on the problems we identified in ten users using the navigation board, we categorized the issues into nine common problems and generated a <span class="highlight">color-coded diagram</span> for further analysis. The <span class="highlight">navigation search board</span> has a large <span class="highlight">gulf of execution</span>, according to our observation.
      </p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>
          The system failed to be compatible with <span class="highlight">spelling errors</span> of the brand name. To address this, the design should allow a certain degree of spelling errors rather than expecting users to enter a flawless input. In addition, the design should improve the <span class="highlight">keyword association</span> function to help users save time in finding their destination, as 6/40 users could not find the brand simply by typing the name.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <span class="highlight">navigation screen design</span> does not account for users born with a poor sense of direction, who find it difficult to read maps. These users need a device that provides simple, clear directions on where to go, rather than requiring them to figure out the entire map.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users often <span class="highlight">forget the route</span> towards their destination and get lost midway. Therefore, they need a portable device that offers continuous guidance along the way.
        </li>
        <li>
          When users spend too much time figuring out the route on the screen, it causes traffic congestion during peak hours, leading to longer waiting times. This highlights the need for an <span class="highlight">easy-to-use portable device</span>, as mentioned in points 2 and 3.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users need <span class="highlight">touch screen features</span> to improve their experience.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Prototyping</h3>
      <h2>Iterative Design Process</h2>
      <hr class="section-divider">
      <p>The first UI paper prototypes were created as low-fidelity representations of user interfaces. These simple sketches included rough outlines of UI elements for the task flow of four solutions.</p>
      <div class="lowfiwatch-row">
        <img src="Watch1.png" alt="low fi design">
        <img src="Watch2.png" alt="low fi design">
        <img src="Watch3.png" alt="low fi design">
        <img src="Watch4.png" alt="low fi design">
        <img src="Watch5.png" alt="low fi design">
      </div>
      <hr>
      <p>
        For the first <span class="highlight">user testing</span>, we used simple sketched drawings to gather feedback. The result shows that the first round of testing lacked effort in three areas: <span class="highlight">time control</span>, <span class="highlight">camera position</span>, and <span class="highlight">scenario building</span>. These issues are interrelated and affect each other, so they need to be solved in order.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        After realizing that our testing was too time-consuming, we decided to create a simple <span class="highlight">scenario</span> for users to more freely explore the features of our device and minimize the amount of interaction between us and the testers. The scenario includes a set of situations users face during their experience using our device, which covers interaction with all the main features.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Another issue we faced during user testing was <span class="highlight">camera positioning</span>. Since our prototype consisted of two large 3D cardboard stands and two of our group members were introducing the device, they constantly blocked the view of the camera. The angle of the camera had to be adjusted frequently, which was extremely time-consuming. We have decided to assign one of our group members to be in charge of the camera. With the new scenario constructed, the blocking issue will no longer exist.

        We were able to showcase an excellent outcome of <span class="highlight">iterative design</span> after conducting <span class="highlight">user testing</span> multiple times. To be more precise, we broke down the design into smaller, more manageable steps and prioritized the main features to create an interface that is easier to use and intuitive. At the end of the project, the <span class="highlight">user feedback increased significantly, and user feedback was overwhelmingly positive.</span>

      <h2>Porject Conclusion</h2>
      <hr class="section-divider">
      <p>
        After completing this assignment, I gained an in-depth understanding of how to conduct iterative design through user testing by obtaining  feedback and making data-driven design decisions, after finishing this assignment. Additionally, I gained a greater understanding of the value of user-centered design concepts, which guarantee that the final product changes to meet the needs of users. In the end, I developed a comprehensive understanding of the design process and realized how crucial it is to be flexible, always strive for progress, and be able to change course when user needs do. My approach to UX design, which bases every choice on user research and validates iteratively through testing, has become more entrenched as a result of this experience.
