      <h3>Our Vision</h3>
      <p>
        As master‚Äôs students with limited income, we have noticed that many students struggle to find affordable housing. The cost of living has risen rapidly since COVID-19, leaving students with few options, many of which offer poor living conditions. The initial goal of this project Homimate is to help students reduce their rent costs. For the future vision, we aim to build a supportive community that promotes strategies for lowering living expenses, such as sharing meals, rides, and more.

      <h3>Research</h3>
      <h2>Initial Problem Discovery</h2>
      <hr class="section-divider">
      <p>
        In recent years, the <span class="highlight">rising rental costs</span> in <span class="highlight">Toronto</span> have made it difficult for students to afford housing, especially since many of them are not yet in full-time employment. As a result, sharing housing with roommates has become a necessity rather than a choice.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        According to <span class="highlight">our secondary research,</span> Toronto has experienced a significant increase in rental prices. As of October 2023, the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Toronto stood at <span class="highlight">$2,550</span>, as reported by Zumper. This marks a <span class="highlight">16 percent increase</span> compared to the previous year.
      </p>

        <div class="comparison-circle1">
          <h2>$2,142</h2>
          <p>The average rental cost for a one-bedroom condo in <span class="highlight"> October 2022</span>, as reported by Zumper.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Circle 2 -->
        <div class="comparison-circle2">
          <h2>$2,550</h2>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Then we used two methods for the <span class="highlight">primary research</span>: <span class="highlight">interviews</span> and <span class="highlight">online surveys</span>. Participants were asked about their previous experiences with shared housing and their preferences for future roommates. The survey also explored their acceptable rental price ranges, willingness to live exclusively with students, and other related concerns.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Our research involved <span class="highlight">10 interviews</span> and <span class="highlight">50 survey responses</span> from university students in Toronto, focusing on shared housing and roommate preferences.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Survey results showed that the most comfortable rental range was <span class="highlight">$1,300 to $1,600</span>, with a preference for <span class="highlight">roommates of similar demographics, occupation, and personality</span>. <span class="highlight">Safety</span> and <span class="highlight">lifestyle compatibility</span> were major concerns, while the willingness to make friends with roommates received <span class="highlight">neutral responses</span>.

      <h2>Persona</h2>
      <hr class="section-divider">
      <p>
        When designing Homimate, we created <span class="highlight">Eric</span> as a persona to represent our target user group‚Äî<span class="highlight">students struggling with high rental costs</span> in Toronto. Eric is a <span class="highlight">23-year-old international student</span>, currently in his first year of graduate studies. As someone new to the city, he has the challenge of <span class="highlight">finding affordable housing</span> while balancing his school life.

    <h2>User Journey</h2>
    <hr class="section-divider">
    <p>
      The emotional journey of the Persona is explored through the problem map below, also known as the Empathy Map, which involves mapping out thoughts, feelings, actions, and pain points to gain a comprehensive understanding of users and their concerns.
    </p>
    <br><p>The <span class="highlight">Problem Map (or Empathy Map)</span> provides a snapshot of Eric‚Äôs key concerns and emotions as he navigates the challenge of finding a suitable roommate.<span class="highlight"> Says:</span> Eric expresses the need for a clean and compatible roommate‚Äîsomeone who can share household responsibilities and help reduce the high cost of living in Toronto. He also hopes to become friends with his roommate.<span class="highlight"> Thinks:</span> Eric worries about information leakage during online roommate searches and the potential for scams. However, he believes that online platforms offer a better chance of finding someone whose lifestyle aligns with his own, particularly in terms of cleanliness and privacy.<span class="highlight"> Does:</span> Eric is proactive in his search, setting up profiles on roommate-finding platforms, communicating with others online, and seeking advice from forums and groups.<span class="highlight"> Feels:</span> Emotionally, Eric experiences a mix of loneliness, excitement, stress, and anxiety as he faces the challenges of high rental costs and the uncertainty of finding a compatible roommate.</p>
    
    <p>The Empathy map highlights that finding a compatible roommate is crucial both financially and socially.</p>

      <p>Drawing from <span class="highlight">researches</span>, <span class="highlight">persona</span>, and <span class="highlight">the analysis of collected data</span>, we came up with many insights.

In the end, we concluded four main challenges that users are facing.</p>        
      <ul>
        <li>Find a student roommate in a short time</li>
        <li>Credibility of roommate finding resource</li>

    <h2 class="next-steps">Results and Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Homimate is a project that covers every step of the user experience design process. It's quite insightful into how to conduct user research, generate ideas through ideation, create a prototype and user interface, and then conduct usability testing to get input from users. We improved the design in response to user feedback, creating a mid-fidelity interface and increasing usability from 30% to 90% of users completing the user flow‚Äîall of which emphasize a significant success in terms of user experience design.</p>
